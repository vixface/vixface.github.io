<h1>Week 7 Critique</h1>
<br>
<h2>Space Jam!</h2>
<br>
<p>Loved this film and it was out at a time when I just so happened to be completely obsessed with NBA Basketball even though I have always lived in London, England.
The combination of Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson  and Bugs Bunny. Genius!
The official website is a little less genius. Although, I love the fact that it hasn’t been updated until 1996 and stands as a shrine to tiled backgrounds, frames, tables, sitemaps, IE6, AOL, Windows 95, basically, a simpler, CSS-free time.</p>
<p>Looking at the homepage, your eyes are drawn to the center as that is where all the content is.
I like the black background colour (well, this is a film about aliens coming from space) with brightly coloured font. At least the yellow on black is readable. Red on black is a bit more problematic. All the body text is in Times New Roman, all other text in headings or icons were created as individual logs and added to the page as gifs.
This almost looks like one of our class examples before we’ve started working on it. <br>
But I can nearly hear “Fly Like An Eagle” by Seal. Basically, I still love it.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Sagmeister & Walsh</h2>
<br>
<p>I have to admit that at least once a week or so, I come back and look at this page.</p>
<p>Big Brother is watching. </p>
Apparently the buttons on the floor have been there since 2013, so there must be some company rule to keep this section of the office as monochrome as much as possible so that visitors can still navigate the page easily. Their bookshelf provides most of the colour.
The monochrome theme continues throughout the site, so that the actual design work is the standout content.</p>
<p>I like the contrast between the front page with its few navigation and social media links, and any page linked from that nav, for example the About Us or News pages, which are packed with information. Packed. Even the pages with mostly pictures, the images are displayed really close together so that when you first click you see at least 8 things at once. Saying that, even when the images are different shapes and sizes, all the contents remains balanced.
I’m not sure the design tries to lead your eye to any particular spot, but instead makes you stop and look at the whole lot. If possible, they want you to look and appreciate everything all at once.
The simple pulldown navigation means that there is even more space to display all the content.
Another clever quirk I liked is as the day gets darker, the homepage icons change from black to white so that you can still see them.
